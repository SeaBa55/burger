## Revisions

burger_v1.0 - Initial commit: Added basic README and .gitignore files.
 
burger_v1.1 - Created a basic working burger app that allows the user to add a burger, devour it, and add it back to the un-devoured section if the user wishes to eat it again.  

burger_v1.2 - Added delete button functionality for each burger that enables the user to remove each burger from burgers_db. App was built using class example, and needs to be refactored to incorporate better styling, remove reduntant or unused code, and clean-up confusing parameter names that may remain for the previous application.

burger_v1.3 - Added functionallity to add new burger to burgers_db if the user decides to eat a burger again. This ensures the burgers that have been devoured serve as a record of all burgers eaten (unless user deletes a burger from the devoured section). 

burger_v1.4 - Refactored code readability (server.js, connection.js, orm.js, burgers_controller.js, burgers.js, burgers.js).

burger_v1.5 - Re-styled burgers front end/ user interface: Added logo in jumbotron; Added a fun static background; Added card div containers along with other bootstrap components to "Add Burger", "Burger Queue", and "Burger History" sections to organize site content and improve the look and feel of the user controls.

burger_v1.6 - Added space between the devour/eat again button and the delete button that appears for each burger in Burger Queue/ History.

burger_v1.7 - Edited README.md file, adding app demo gif and deployed heroku link.
